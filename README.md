Bike Buyers Analytics Dashboard
1.	Bar Chart (Marital Status):
Question: How does the count of bike purchases vary among different marital statuses? Are married individuals more likely to purchase bikes?
•	Use a pivot table to count bike purchases based on marital status.
•	Create a bar chart based on the pivot table.

2.	Bar Chart (Gender):
Question: Build a bar graph to compare the count of male and female customers. Does gender influence bike purchases, and if so, to what extent
•	Similar to task 1, use a pivot table to count bike purchases by gender.
•	Create a bar chart based on the pivot table.

3.	Histogram (Income):
Question: What is the distribution of income among bike buyers? Are there specific income brackets that show a higher likelihood of bike purchases?
•	Use a pivot table to categorize income into bins.
•	Create a bar chart to visualize the income distribution.

4.	Histogram (Age):
Question: Create a histogram to understand the age distribution of bike buyers. Are certain age groups more inclined to purchase bikes?
•	Similar to task 3, use a pivot table to categorize age into bins.
•	Create a bar chart to visualize the age distribution.

5.	Box Plot (Income):
Question: Identify outliers in the income distribution of bike buyers. Are there any extreme income values, and how might they impact purchasing behavior?
The box plot below visualizes the distribution of income among bike buyers. Key statistical values such as minimum, maximum, and quartiles (Q1 and Q3)

6.	Pie Chart (Region):
Question: Represent the distribution of bike purchases by region using a pie chart. Are there regions where bike purchases are notably higher?
 •	Use a pivot table to count bike purchases by region.
 •	Create a pie chart based on the pivot table.

7.	Scatter Plot (Income vs. Age):
Question: Create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between income and age. Do individuals with higher incomes tend to be in specific age groups?
•	Create a scatter plot with income on one axis and age on the other.

8.	Stacked Bar Chart (Marital Status & Gender):
Question: How does the distribution of bike purchases differ when considering both marital status and gender simultaneously? Are there notable patterns?
•	Use a pivot table to count bike purchases by both marital status and gender.
•	Create a stacked bar chart based on the pivot table.

9.	Correlation Heatmap (Numeric Variables):
Question: Use a heatmap to visualize the correlation matrix between numeric variables. What variables show a strong correlation, and how might this influence purchasing behavior?
•	Calculate correlations between numeric variables using the CORREL function.
•	Use a heatmap or bubble chart to visualize the correlation matrix.
